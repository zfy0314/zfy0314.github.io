I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Robotics Institute. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Reid Simmons](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/reid-simmons/) and [Prof. Jean Oh](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jean-hyaejin-oh/). I am working in the intersection of Neuro-Symbolic AI, Human-AI Collaboration, Cognitive Robotics.

Previously, I was an undergraduate at CMU School of Computer Science, majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** with an additional major in *Cognitive Science*.
My undergraduate thesis was advised by Prof. Reid Simmons on combining LLMs with Cognitive Architecture.
I have also explored human-AI collaboration in Hanabi.
My work was supported by [SUCCESS MURI](https://successmuri.org/) and [NSF AI-CARING](https://www.ai-caring.org/) grants.
I also had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/) and [Prof. Alexander Mathis](https://people.epfl.ch/alexander.mathis/?lang=en) during my undergraduate studies.
Before CMU I spent a year at [Megvii](https://en.megvii.com/) as a research intern primarily working on pedestrian tracking.

I grew up in Beijing, China.
In my limited free time, I enjoy napping, driving, biking, and playing chess.
