I am a senior undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) School of Computer Science, majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** with an additional major in *Cognitive Science*.
My advisor is [Prof. Reid Simmons](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/reid-simmons/), and I am part of the [Reliable Autonomous Systems Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/reliable-autonomous-systems-lab/).
My research interests mainly revolve around **human-AI collaboration**.
My work is supported by [SUCCESS MURI](https://successmuri.org/) and [NSF AI-CARING](https://www.ai-caring.org/) grants.

I also had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/) and [Prof. Alexander Mathis](https://people.epfl.ch/alexander.mathis/?lang=en) during my undergraduate studies.
Before CMU I spent a year at [Megvii](https://en.megvii.com/) as a research intern primarily working on pedestrian tracking.

I grew up in Beijing, China.
In my limited free time, I enjoy napping, driving, biking, and playing chess.
