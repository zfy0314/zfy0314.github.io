At Carnegie Mellon University I serve as a teaching assistant for two introductory-level AI courses [**15-281 AI Representation and Problem Solving**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15281/) and **07-180 Concepts in AI**.
The first is the "standard" intro to AI course (similar to [CS 188 at UC Berkeley](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/)) and the latter is a half-semester mini course designed for students to decide whether they want to major in AI.

In addition to the regular TA responsibilities (e.g., holding office hours, grading assignments), I spend time emphasizing the 1) **motivations of different topics**, 2) **how they are connected to each other**, and 3) **how they can be extended outside the scope of the course**.
Personally, I believe having a solid understanding of the fundamental idea behind an algorithm is the most important part of learning, and the appreciation of non-learning methods in AI is crucial yet overlooked in the current era overwhelmed by deep learning.

Among other materials that I have created, I am particularly proud of the design of the [Search as IP](https://zfy0314.github.io/files/Search_as_IP.pdf) problem, which aims to solidify the student's understanding of both search algorithms and integer programming.
(But it is unfortunately deemed as too hard for the course).
